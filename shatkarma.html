        <h1>Understanding Shatkarma</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Shatkarma</strong> refers to a set of six traditional yogic purification practices described in ancient yogic texts such as the <em>Hatha Yoga Pradipika</em>. These cleansing methods are designed to maintain the body’s health, vitality, and clarity by removing toxins and obstacles that may hinder the flow of <em>prana</em> (life energy) throughout the system.
        </p>
        <p>
            By regularly performing shatkarmas, practitioners can prepare their bodies for deeper yogic practices like <em>pranayama</em> (breath control) and meditation. A purified body helps reduce distractions, discomfort, and fatigue, making advanced yogic techniques more accessible and effective.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Shatkarmas should only be learned and practiced under the guidance of a knowledgeable and experienced teacher to ensure safety and effectiveness.
        </div>
        <h2>The Six Yogic Purification Techniques</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Neti:</strong> A nasal cleansing technique that purifies the nasal passages and sinuses. It can be performed using a saline solution with a neti pot (<em>jala neti</em>) or by gently threading a soft string through the nostrils and out the mouth (<em>sutra neti</em>).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dhauti:</strong> A series of cleansing methods for the digestive tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and intestines. There are several types, such as swallowing a strip of cloth to clear mucus and impurities from the upper digestive system.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Nauli:</strong> An abdominal massage technique that uses controlled movements of the abdominal muscles to stimulate and tone the digestive organs. This practice involves rolling the abdominal muscles in a wave-like motion to generate internal heat and promote digestion.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Basti:</strong> A method for cleansing the large intestine. In <em>jala basti</em>, water is drawn into the colon while sitting in a tub, using yogic muscle control, and then expelled to flush out impurities.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Kapalabhati:</strong> Known as the “skull-shining breath,” this practice involves forceful exhalations powered by the abdominal muscles, followed by passive inhalations. It is repeated rapidly to energize the mind and clear the respiratory passages.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Trataka:</strong> A concentration technique that involves gazing steadily at a single point, often a candle flame, without blinking. This practice cleanses the eyes and enhances mental focus and clarity.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why Practice Shatkarma?</h2>
        <p>
            The shatkarmas are more than just physical cleansing routines—they are foundational practices in yoga that help harmonize the body and mind. By removing internal blockages and impurities, these techniques support overall well-being and pave the way for deeper spiritual growth.
